				<p>
					Linux is considered to be "harder" than windows or macos.
					That isn't really true. The "problem" is that people just
					don't care enought to change their OS. But if you came out
					of your way just to find this article, then i think you
					probably should. You will find a lot of linux "propaganda"
					on the net and some of the points they make are true. Linux
					for desktop usage isn't for everyone, but so is windows, yet
					like 90% of people use it. The only reason that may hold you
					back is videogames and proprietary legacy programs.
